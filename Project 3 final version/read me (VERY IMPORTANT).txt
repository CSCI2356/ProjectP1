Below are the calls inside mongodb to create the required collections for the code to work 

mongo -u hm_agowun --authenticationDatabase hm_agowun -p

show collections
use hm_agowun
db.studentInbox.insertOne({emails:[]});
db.adminSent.insertOne({emails:[]});
db.studentSent.insertOne({emails:[]});
db.adminInbox.insertOne({emails:[]});
show collections


ALSO our project has a DEBUG flag
    if you want helpful messages to be displayed to help debugging set BOTH of the following booleans to TRUE
    DEBUG is constants.js
    DEBUG_SERVER in server.js

The structure of the scripts:
Our team tried very hard to breakdown the scripts as much as possible.
In the project directory: 
    you will find server.js which should be run with node server.js
        The file contains ALL the server code.

In the styles directory:
    You will find index.css which contains the styles used by all the screens.
    Note that the help windows use another css file in scripts/helps/help.css to turn the pages blue

In the script directory:    /************VERY IMPORTANT*************/
    the read me file in this directory explains how the JSON and the collections are set up.
    You will find constant.js:
        It contains all the constants that ALL the files use. Be sure to be familiar with them.
    The composing directory contains all the scripts that help the composing screens. 
        Read the "read me" in it for more details.
    The helps directory contains all the scripts AND the html for the help screens.
        Read the "read me" there for more details.
    The inboxAndSentItems directory contains all the scripts used by the inbox and sent items screens. 
        Read the "read me" there for more details.
    The viewEmails directory contains all the scripts used by the viewInbox and viewSent screens.
        Read the "read me" there for more details.
